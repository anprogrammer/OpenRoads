			<p><span>Q: </span>What is the Jump-o Master?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				<span>A: </span>The Jump-o Master is a simple AI, part of your ship, which assists you on your mission.  If it detects that you are going to fall into nothingness, it can instantly alter your speed
				so that you don't undershoot or overshoot your landing.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has limitations in how much it can alter your speed, and also won't save you from crashing into a block or tunnel.

			<p><span>Q: </span>Why won't my Xbox 360 controller work?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				<span>A: </span>As a security feature, some browsers won't allow us to use your Xbox 360 controller until you press the &quot;A&quot; button to enable it.

			<p><span>Q: </span>I'd like to make a donation.</p>

				<span>A: </span>You caught me, this is neither a question nor has anyone ever asked it.
			</p>
			<p>Consider donating to the <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox project</a> instead. It's a great project run by great people (pretty much for free),
				and was absolutely integral to the creation of OpenRoads.</p>
