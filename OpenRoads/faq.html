		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				<span>A: </span>The Jump-o Master is a simple AI, part of your ship, which assists you on your mission.  If it detects that you are going to fall into nothingness, it can instantly alter your speed
				so that you don't undershoot or overshoot your landing.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has limitations in how much it can alter your speed, and also won't save you from crashing into a block or tunnel.
